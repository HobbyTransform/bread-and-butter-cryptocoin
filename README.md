Bread and Butter Coin - A Barebones SHA256 PoW Blockchain w/ GUI wallet

Hi guys! This is my first step into programming a blockchain / distributed ledger technology (DLT). I call this cryptocurrency the "Bread and Butter Coin" or BNBC for short. There is no real meaning to the name I just thought it was funny.

But in all seriousness, I'm working on making a functional blockchain (with a mining wallet and GUI) for learning purposes. This code currently only contains the block and blockchain classes as a proof-of concept but I am programming a full node desktop application for proof of work (PoW) mining including a basic wallet that can sign and broadcast its transactions to the network. If you're brand new to blockchain coding you may want to learn from this project to help you get started coding your own blockchain or fork an existing one.
